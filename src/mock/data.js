    "Hello, my name is Michaela. I am nearly a year out of college and trying to figure out where I belong in the vast world of technology. I am currently working as a Data Analyst for a major bank in NY. Although data is fascinating, the work isn't fulfilling. I would love to fine a position as a web developer and create elegantly functional websites for clients. Currently I specialize in Front end but I am slowly dipping my toe into the daunting world of Back end.",
